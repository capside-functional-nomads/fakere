#+title: faKere

Exercise for the third session of the CAPSiDE functional nomads.


* Intro

To implement a small single-user TO-DO list as a web application. To be able
to focus on learning, we will use the provided skeleton app and work in
_fill-in-the-blanks_ mode.

** Repo structure

   The repo has some intereting tags

   - =bare-bones= web infrastructure in place. No features.
   - =starting-point= sample features implemented.

** Agenda

   - Show the starting point (=starting-point= tag) while explaining
     - Recap of LISP/clojure syntax
     - Recap of lists, vectors and maps
     - Functions and destructuring
     - Namespaces
     - Your first 10' with web apps in clojure
       - ring apps from =bare-bones=
       - compojure from =starting-point=
     - Your first 10' with clojurescript and re-frame (from =starting-point=)
     - Q&A
     - Code the features:
       - Create a new task
       - Mark a task as completed
       - Delete a task

* Starting

  1. clone the repo
  2. start the database
  3. =lein trampoline run=
  4. Implement the user stories
